It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about human creativity monitoring social networks and photo-/video-sharing websites such as Facebook, Picasa and Vimeo. Together with the mining of exhibition and artwork announcements and reviews in W3, these digital tools are ideal candidates to serve the "quantified artist" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their artistic output, to find patterns in their works, or simply because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This reserach analysis makes use of data from one specific media artist.
