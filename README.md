It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about human creativity monitoring social networks and photo-/video-sharing websites such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tobias.rosenberger.7), [Picasa](http://picasaweb.google.com/tobiasrosenberger80) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/tobiasrosenberger). Together with the mining of exhibition/artwork announcements, descriptions and reviews in W3, these digital platforms are ideal candidates to serve the "quantified artist" movement -- a group of creative enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their artistic output, to find patterns in their works, or simply because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are scattered to the three w's and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This github repository provides data from one specific media artist ([Tobias Rosenberger](http://tobiasrosenberger.de/)).
